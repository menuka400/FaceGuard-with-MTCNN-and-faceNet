## 📌Core Concepts

### 🔹1. **MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)**
MTCNN is a three-stage deep learning-based face detector:
- **🔸 P-Net (Proposal Network)**

📌 This first stage is a fully convolutional network (FCN). The difference between a CNN and a FCN is that a fully convolutional network does not use a dense layer as part of the architechture. This Proposal Network is used to obtain candidate windows and their bounding box regression vectors.

Bounding box regression is a popular technique to predict the localization of boxes when the goal is detecting an object of some pre-defined class, in this case faces. After obtaining the bounding box vectors, some refinement is done to combine overlapping regions. The final output of this stage is all candidate windows after refinement to downsize the volume of candidates.

- **🔸 R-Net (Refinement Network)**

📌 All candidates from the P-Net are fed into the Refine Network. Notice that this network is a CNN, not a FCN like the one before since there is a dense layer at the last stage of the network architecture. The R-Net further reduces the number of candidates, performs calibration with bounding box regression and employs non-maximum suppression (NMS) to merge overlapping candidates.

The R-Net outputs wether the input is a face or not, a 4 element vector which is the bounding box for the face, and a 10 element vector for facial landmark localization.

- **🔸 O-Net (Output Network)**

📌 This stage is similar to the R-Net, but this Output Network aims to describe the face in more detail and output the five facial landmarks’ positions for eyes, nose and mouth.

### 🔹2. **FaceNet**
📌 FaceNet takes an image of the person’s face as input and outputs a vector of 128 or 512 numbers which represent the most important features of a face. In machine learning, this vector is called embedding. Why embedding? Because all the important information from an image is embedded into this vector. Basically, FaceNet takes a person’s face and compresses it into a vector of 128 numbers. Ideally, embeddings of similar faces are also similar.

Mapping high-dimensional data (like images) into low-dimensional representations (embeddings) has become a fairly common practice in machine learning these days.

### 🔹3. **Image Pyramid & Sliding Window in Face Detection**

- **✅Image Pyramid**: Image Pyramids are one of the most beautiful concept of image processing.Normally, we work with images with default resolution but many times we need to change the **resolution (lower it) or resize the original image** in that case image pyramids comes handy.The `pyrUp()` function increases the size to double of its original size and `pyrDown()` function decreases the size to half. If we keep the original image as a base image and go on applying `pyrDown` function on it and keep the images in a vertical stack, it will look like a pyramid. The same is true for upscaling the original image by `pyrUp function`.Once we scale down and if we rescale it to the original size, we lose some information and the resolution of the new image is much lower than the original one.🔍

- **✅Sliding Window**: A sliding window is a rectangular region that shifts around the whole image(pixel-by-pixel) at each scale. Each time the window shifts, the window region is applied to the classifier and detects whether that region has Haar features of a face.

This is what the sliding window combined with the image pyramid looks like. By this, we can detect face at different scales and locations of an image.🎯

### 🔹4. **Face Embeddings & Similarity Calculation**
📌Face embeddings are numerical representations of facial features extracted from an image. These embeddings are used for comparing and recognizing faces based on their similarity in a high-dimensional space.

  ### I. **What Are Face Embeddings?**
  📌 Face embeddings are fixed-length feature vectors generated by a deep learning model like FaceNet. Instead of comparing raw pixel values, embeddings capture unique facial characteristics in a way that allows
  for easy comparison.
  
  🎯 Each face is mapped to a 512-dimensional vector (for FaceNet).
  🎯 Similar faces have embeddings that are close to each other in this high-dimensional space.
  🎯 Different faces have embeddings that are far apart from each other.

  ### II. **What Are Face Embeddings?**

   ### a. **Face Detection (MTCNN)**
   🎯 A face is first detected using MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks).
   🎯 The face is aligned and cropped to a fixed size (e.g., 160x160 pixels).

   ### b. **Feature Extraction (FaceNet)**
   🎯 The aligned face is passed through FaceNet, a deep CNN model.
   🎯 The model generates a 512-dimensional embedding vector, which represents the facial features.

   ### c. **Storing the Embedding**
   🎯 The embedding is stored in a database for future comparison.

  ### III. **Face Similarity Calculation**
📌 To recognize a person, a new face embedding is generated and compared with stored embeddings. The similarity is computed using **distance metrics**.

**📏 Euclidean Distance Formula 📏**

📌 The Euclidean distance measures how far two embeddings are from each other in a straight line.
  
$$
d(A, B) = \sqrt{\sum (A_i - B_i)^2}
$$

🎯 Smaller distance → More similar faces.

🎯 Larger distance → Less similar faces.

🎯 A common threshold for recognition is d < 0.8 (lower is better).
